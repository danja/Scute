The material under org.hdesktop is derived from org.jdesktop, the SwingX libraries. 
While this material is currently in the same tree as org.hyperdata, that's only for convenience during development.
For release purpose it will be packaged separately retaining the original LGPL license, whereas org.hyperdata will 
be under the (more liberal) Apache2 license.
