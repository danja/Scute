RdfTree/Editor



to build, run ant

for now - to run, copy the .sh files from the etc dir into the dist/rdftree dir
chmod & run 'em

rdftree.sh runs a demo of the component alone

editor.sh runs the editor - 
to see as far as it's got, open an rdf/xml file, click a couple of times on the arrow pointer next to the root icon
