[important application : building complex datasets that are beyond individual queries (maybe because of timeout) ]

check Henry's graph nav language in Clerezza

SPARQL query chains

g1 = resultOf( CONSTRUCT {} WHERE {} )
g2 = resultOf( CONSTRUCT {} WHERE {} )

SELECT {} WHERE { g1 & g2 }

just give them names?

want caching - so unless query has changed, result is simple lookup
lazy evaluation

q1 = """CONSTRUCT {} WHERE {}"""
endpoint = <http://example.org/sparql>

g1 = graph(endpoint, q1)
g2 = graph(endpoint2, q2)

r = """SELECT {} WHERE { x1 & x2 }""" with g1, g2
 
view = xslt(r, html)

print view
